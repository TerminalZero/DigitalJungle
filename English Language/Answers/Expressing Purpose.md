# Adverbials

**Adverbials** can be defined as an adverb, ***phrase****, or entire ***clause**** that is used to modify a verb, adjective, or other adverb.

They address any questions one may have pertaining to the ***manner***, ***place***, ***time***, ***frequency***, ***degree***, ***condition***, or ***reason*** for an action or event **--**
otherwise known as the ***how***, ***where***, ***when***, ***how often***, ***to what extent***, ***under what conditions***, or *"**why?**"*.

**Adverbs** are the single-word *subclass* of adverbials. Many adverbs in English end in ***"-ly"***, often specifying particularly the ***manner*** in which something is done.
For example: quick**ly**, slow**ly**, careful**ly**, and quiet**ly**, and many others.
Some **Adjectives** double as adverbs **--** which don't have the ***"-ly"*** ending, such as ***"well"*** as in ***"she sings well"*** and ***"fast"*** as in ***"he runs fast"***.

**Phrases** are a group of words that function as a single unit in the syntax of a sentence.
For example, ***"in the morning"*** is a phrase, because it functions as a *single unit* in the sentence.

**Clauses** are a group of words that contains a ***subject*** and a ***predicate***.
For example, ***"when the sun rises"*** is a clause, because it contains a subject ***(the sun)*** and a predicate ***(rises)***.
**Note:** Since ***adverbial clauses*** are a type of ***dependent clause***, they will *always* begin with a ***subordinating conjunction***.

**Consider the following examples of adverbials:**

* Purpose Phrase Adverbial: "She went to the store ***[to buy]*** *(to-infinitive)* ***[milk]*** *(object)*."
* Purpose Clause Adverbial: "He saved money ***[so that]*** *(conjunction)* ***[he]*** *(subject)* ***[could travel]*** *(predicate)*."
* Reason Phrase Adverbial: "He left early ***[because of]*** *(compound preposition)* ***[the traffic]*** *(object)*."
* Reason Clause Adverbial: "It was cleaned ***[because]*** *(conjunction)* ***[it]*** *(subject)* ***[was dirty]*** *(predicate)*."
* Conditional Phrase Adverbial: "***[In case of]*** *(compound preposition)* ***[emergency]*** *(object)*, break glass."
* Conditional Clause Adverbial: "I will go ***[if]*** *(conjunction)* ***[you]*** *(subject)* ***[come]*** *(predicate)*."

Understand the nuance between purpose and reason adverbials:
* **Purpose** adverbials explain the ***goal*** or ***intention*** behind an action.
* **Reason** adverbials explain the ***cause*** or ***motivation*** behind an action.

They both answer the question *"**why?**"*, but from different perspectives. One looks forward to the intended outcome (getting milk), while the other looks back at the factor that prompted the action (traffic).

**Adverbials** are a crucial part of sentence structure, providing essential information about the circumstances surrounding an action or event. They add depth and specificity to the meaning of a sentence, helping to clarify the relationship between different elements and convey the speaker's intent more clearly.
