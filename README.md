## Work in progress

[digitaljungle.tech](https://digitaljungle.tech) will be a blog/forum where users can share their experiences and knowledge about technology, programming, and other related topics. The blog will be open to everyone, and users will be able to create, edit, and delete their posts.

## What here now:
* Some cool regular expressions I wrote for use in the [Rabbit Hole](https://github.com/TerminalZero/RabbitHoleExtension) extension.
* A *bunch* of raw data, mostly extracted from [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/)' [Georgetown University Multilayer corpus](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-GUM/blob/master/README.md) (led by Amir Zeldes).
* A few notes on [Adverbials](/English%20Language/Answers/Expressing%20Purpose.md) I wrote, as it relates to Rabbit Hole's analyzing and pooling of *meaningful* data from the webpage.
